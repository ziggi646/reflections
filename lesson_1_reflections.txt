Zohaib Rathore's ongoing musings and learnings:

<Version Control>
Important to keep track of versions of programs I create. Since I plan to be doing this quite a bit, I should 
probably start now and utilize best practices.

<Bash Terminal>
Here we go...  I need to try and learn how to use the terminal on my mac. This will take some time. A few 
basics to remember:
	cd: change director
	mkdir: make directory
	subl: launch sublime
	pwd: print working directory
	ls: print whats in directory
	diff: difference between two files (-u makes it easier)

<Using Git>
I already have Git installed. Can easily check by using git --version. Here are the key commands:
	git clone <path>: Copies file from <path> to local folder from the Git repository.
	git log: Version history of the code.
	git diff <1> <2>: Details of what code changed between two log ids. Note <1> is before <2>.
	git checkout <1>: Change version to prior version of code contained in <1>.
	git init: starts git repository locally on computer.
	git status: provides information on the .git folder.
